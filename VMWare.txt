vCLI= vSphere CLI

****************************************
vSphere CLI Command Set
****************************************
+ ESXCLI commands
+ vicfg- commands : eventually replaced by ESXCLI commands
+ Other commands: vmware-cmd, vifs, vmkfstools

****************************************
vSphere API
****************************************
+ Is a language-neutral web service.
+ 3 types of object:  
-- Managed Objects: represent vSphere services and components. Services include PropertyCollector, SearchIndex,PerformanceManager, ViewManager. Components include: VM, datastore, folder.
-- Managed object reference: client application references to server-side managed objects.
-- Data objects: contain info about managed objects. Client applications end data objects to and receive data objects from a vSphere server.

+ Inventory Object: 
-- Systems in the datacenter: Host, VirtualMachine, VirtualApp
-- Support components: ComputerResource, Datastore, Network and virtual devices
-- Organizational components: folder and datacenter

Terminologies
****************************************
Source: vCenter Server and Host Management/vSphere Concepts and Features
+ Datacenter: an logical aggregation of different types of physical resources (doesn't have to be constrained by the physical location)
Note: vMotion and Storage vMotion doesn't work across datacenter. vNetwork Distributed Switch is limited to within a datacenter.

Typically consists of: ESX servers, storage network and arrays (SAN,iSCSI SAN, NAS), IP Networks, vCenter Server

+ Cluster: a collection of ESX or ESXi hosts and associated virtual machines. Physical resources from all the hosts within a cluster are jointly owned by 
the cluster and centrally managed by the vCenter Server.
vSphere administrator must create clusters to use cluster-level resource management features: 
	+ High Availability (HA)
	+ Fault Tolerance (FT)
	+ Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS)	
	+ Distributed Power Management (DPM)
+ Resource Pool: collection of resources (usually within a cluster). Used to compartmentalize the CPU and memory resources of a host or cluster. VMs execute in, and draw their resources from resource pools.

+ Datastores: a virtual representation of the underlying physical storage resources in the datacenter.
+ Inventory: collection of virtual and physical objects on which admin can put permissions, monitor tasks and events and set alarms.

+ vMotion: a feature that enables moving running VMs from one ESXi host to another (hot migration)
+ Storage vMotion: a feature that enables moving disks and configuration files of a running VM from one datastore to another (hot)


+ Resources: CPU, memory, power, storage, and network resources
